# SFSU ENGR 478 Group Project (3): Automated Watering Plant System
by Lang Cheng, Christopher Martin, Basim Baylor

The goal of this project is to design a watering mechanism for household plants. The embedded system will automatically respond to changes in soil moisture read from the sensor, and will water the plant via an electronic pump when the soil is too dry.

The key component of our project is a Bipolar Junction Transistor, whose on/off base voltage is determined by the output switching behavior of our STM32L476RG NUCLEO-64.

Visual Studio Code and GitHub were integral tools to to foster collaboration and facilitate concurrent code revisions, enhancing the efficiency of testing processes within Keil MDK for this embedded project.
